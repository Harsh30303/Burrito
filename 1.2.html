        <h1><em>Rice</em></h1>
        <p>rice, (Oryza sativa), edible starchy cereal grain and the grass plant (family Poaceae) by which it is produced. Roughly one-half of the world population, including virtually all of East and Southeast Asia, is wholly dependent upon rice as a staple food; 95 percent of the worldâ€™s rice crop is eaten by humans. Rice is cooked by boiling, or it can be ground into a flour. </p>
